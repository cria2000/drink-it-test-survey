# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Introduction
이 프로그램은 자신과 잘 어울리는 술과 공간을 찾아볼 수 있는 DITI 성격 유형 테스트입니다.
뉴스레터 'drink It'에서 소개되었던 술과 공간들을 바탕으로 하고 있습니다.

## How to run a program
프로그램을 clone 받으신 뒤에, HCI_2018008722_유수영_Project1Programming로 이동하여 아래의 명령어를 실행하여 프로그램을 실행해주세요.

- .env 파일이 없어 카카오톡 공유하기 및 구글 어낼리틱스의 작동은 원활하지 않을 수 있습니다.
- 기본적인 사이트의 작동은 문제 없이 잘 작동합니다.

1. 필요한 package 설치

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
